# 2d-color-picker

 I tried to rethink way we approach one very simple task - selection of color. My color picker has colors organized only in two dimensional plane instead of usual three dimensional cube.

[2D color picker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Linzee/2d-color-picker/master/output/colorScheme.png)

### Usage

Just display image to user and read a color of pixel on position where he pointed.

### Generate own color scheme

Scripts in this repository can be utilized to generate your own 2D color picker. You have to provide folder containing photos used for creating model of relations between colors.
